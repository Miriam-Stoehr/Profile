## About Me

<p>I am a data analytics trainee and aspiring data scientist with a strong analytical background, transitioning into the tech industry. My expertise bridges political science, economics, and cultural studies, complemented by hands-on experience in accounting, treasury management, and controlling. This interdisciplinary foundation has shaped my ability to approach complex problems with a data-driven mindset.

During my career in finance and business operations, I identified inefficiencies in data management and workflow processes, leading me to implement improved data integration and reporting solutions. By streamlining data entry and access through Power Query and centralized file management, I reduced redundancy and improved collaboration across departments. These experiences sparked my passion for leveraging data and technology to enhance business operations and decision-making.

Currently, I am refining my technical skills through the BeCode Data Science & AI Bootcamp, where I work on real-world projects involving data analytics, machine learning, and AI. My ultimate goal is to apply data science techniques to address societal challenges, such as misinformation, political education, and support for disadvantaged communities.</p>
