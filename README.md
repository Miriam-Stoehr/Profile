## About Me

<p>I am a data analytics trainee and aspiring data scientist with a strong analytical background, currently transitioning into the tech industry. My foundation bridges political science, economics, and cultural studies, complemented by hands-on experience in finance, accounting, and controlling. This interdisciplinary perspective helps me approach complex questions with a data-driven and structured mindset.

In my previous roles in finance and business operations, I identified inefficiencies in data handling and reporting workflows, leading initiatives that improved data integration, transparency, and collaboration. These experiences sparked my interest in using data and technology to drive smarter decision-making.

Currently, I am enhancing my technical skills through the BeCode Data Science & AI Bootcamp, where I work on applied projects involving machine learning, data analysis, and interactive dashboards. I am especially interested in roles where I can combine analytical thinking, technical tools, and domain knowledge to apply data science in ways that solve real problems, improve processes and contribute to positive, tangible change.</p>
