My academic and professional experiences have fostered a strong analytical mindset and a keen interest in applying technology to solve complex problems.</p>

<h2>üéì Background and Motivation</h2>

<p>
My background in Modern East Asian Studies and political and social science has provided me with a deep understanding of global perspectives and societal dynamics. This foundation, combined with my professional experience, has shaped my commitment to using technology for meaningful improvements in both business processes and societal impact.
  
During my tenure as an Accountant and Junior Controller, I encountered inefficiencies and redundancies withing the workflows, such as repeated manual entry of data across different systems. To address issues like this and as a result reduce errors, streamline connectec work tasks and improve employee satisfaction, I developed systems to improve data entry, access and usability. In addition, I enhanced team collaboration by implementing a centralized file-sharing solution, which eliminated data loss and redundancy and improved communication and team-work.

Inspired by the positive impacts of these projects, I started deepening my technical skills through online courses with the objective to continue developing robust, secure solutions that optimize workflows and foster effective collaboration across various sectors.
